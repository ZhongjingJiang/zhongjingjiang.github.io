    summary: |
      It was a great experience to participate in the first BNL Research SLAM competition, and it was an honor to win second place (my presentation begins at 28:40 in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWkuOtVzpVQ&t=5s)). The SLAM competition is like an 'elevator talk'; participants gave three-minute talks on their research, prepared for a general audience. This event reinforced my commitment to improving the communication of scientific concepts to the public, a mission I will passionately pursue in the future.

## About Me
Hello! My name is Zhongjing Jiang (姜中景). I am a Research Scientist at the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. 
With a diverse academic background in mathematics, atmospheric science, and environmental studies, and as my work bridges the atmospheric, terrestrial, and oceanic components of the Earth system, I identify myself as an interdisciplinary Earth system scientist. Currently, my research focuses on agricultural ecosystem modeling and bioenergy systems. I’m always excited to engage in discussions about atmospheric science, climate issues, energy, and sustainability.
