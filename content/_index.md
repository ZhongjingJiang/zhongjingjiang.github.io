      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research focuses on addressing the complex challenges posed by climate change, with an emphasis on Earth System Modeling, chemistry-climate interactions, and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Drawing on my academic background in applied mathematics and atmospheric science, I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of the intricate relationships within the Earthâ€™s climate system as well as finding sustainable solutions to the world.
        
        Prior to joining UIUC, I did my postdoc at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where my work spanned the Environmental and Climate Sciences Department and the Computer Science Initiative. This experience provided me with a unique perspective at the intersection of climate science and computational methodologies.

        I envision my research to contribute to both scientific understanding and practical solutions for pressing climate and environmental challenges. My focus lies particularly in terrestrial ecosystems, air quality, climate variability, and improving climate model predictability. By leveraging my interdisciplinary expertise, I aim to unravel the complexities of Earth system and climate modeling, offering insights that enhance scientific knowledge and inform nature-based solutions for mitigating global climate challenges, particularly in the agricultural domain.
