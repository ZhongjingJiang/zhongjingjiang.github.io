      title: Popular science articles
      text: I believe that in addition to focusing on scientific research, scientists should also actively take on the responsibility of popularizing science and promote public understanding and support of science by spreading scientific knowledge. Beyond my research, I enjoy writing. The following are some popular science articles I have written.
