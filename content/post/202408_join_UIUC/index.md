## Summary
After spending two years as a postdoc at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where I had the advantage of collaborating with talented scientists who are experts in field campaigns, Earth system modeling, and computational science, I am thrilled to embark on a new journey as a Research Scientist at the [Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment](https://sustainability.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) as well as the [Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI)](https://cabbi.bio/). 
In this role, I will be working with Professor [Kaiyu Guan](http://faculty.nres.illinois.edu/~kaiyuguan/), leveraging my expertise in Uncertainty Quantification and Earth system modeling to address the pressing challenges of climate change from the agricultural perspective. I am committed to developing sustainable solutions integrating climate science with agriculture, aiming to contribute to a more resilient and sustainable future.
Looking forward to all the challenges and opportunities ahead!
