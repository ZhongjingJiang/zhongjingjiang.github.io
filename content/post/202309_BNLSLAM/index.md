## Summary
It was a great experience to participate in the first [BNL Research SLAM competition](https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=221522), and it was an honor to win second place (my presentation begins at 28:40 in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWkuOtVzpVQ)).
The SLAM competition is like an â€™elevator talkâ€™; participants gave three-minute talks on their research, prepared for a general audience. This event reinforced my commitment to improving the communication of scientific concepts to the public, a mission I will passionately pursue in the future.
